 <p>
  Hi, I'm <strong>Jaymar Yecyec</strong>, a graduate of <strong>Cordova Catholic Cooperative School</strong>. 
  My name is Jaymar Yecyec, a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student.
I chose this course because of my interest in computers and technology. Through BSIT, I’m learning skills like programming, networking, and database management.
Although the course is challenging, I enjoy the hands-on projects and teamwork. My goal is to become a skilled IT professional, and I’m dedicated to working hard to reach that dream.
